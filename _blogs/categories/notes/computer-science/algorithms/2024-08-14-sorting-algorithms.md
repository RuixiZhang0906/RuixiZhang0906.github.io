# Sorting Algorithms Overview

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms that require input data to be in sorted lists.

## Common Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Merge Sort

Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.

### Quick Sort

Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.
