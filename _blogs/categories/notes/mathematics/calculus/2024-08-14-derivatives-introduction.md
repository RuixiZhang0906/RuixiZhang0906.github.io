# Introduction to Derivatives

In calculus, a derivative is a measure of how a function changes as its input changes. It is one of the fundamental tools of calculus.

## Definition

The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as the interval approaches zero:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

## Basic Rules

1. **Constant Rule**: The derivative of a constant is zero.
2. **Power Rule**: For $f(x) = x^n$, the derivative is $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.
3. **Sum Rule**: The derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

## Applications

Derivatives have many applications in science, engineering, and economics, including:
- Finding rates of change
- Determining maximum and minimum values
- Analyzing the behavior of functions
